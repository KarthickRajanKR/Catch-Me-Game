# Catch-Me-Game
I wanted to create a game without using a game engine. Then I found about LÖVE2D framework to make 2D games.
While, I was learning LÖVE2D and vector math, I come up with this simple basic game.

The game is about survivng against enemies. Where the player can shoot a ball and it will
return back to the player like boomerang. Use this cool trick to make your survival easier!
